# Plotly-Belly-Bottom-Biodiversity

## Purpose of this project:
The purpose of this project was to build a dashboard that will allow the volunteers to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. The dashboard includes a panel for demographic information and should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in each volunteer's belly button. This will help the volunteers identify whether a particular species found in their navel is a candidate for manufacturing synthetic beef by Improbable Beef.

## Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
In order to create a dashboard that visualizes bacterial data for volunteers. 
I retrieved and filtered the data for the selected sample from a JSON file and created variables for the necessary data to plot a bar chart. 
Then I created a trace object and layout
In the end, plotted the bar chart using Plotly, and the resulting chart displays the top 10 bacterial species in a volunteer's belly button.
